## Introduction
This guide will help you install Fultimator on your macOS system. Fultimator supports macOS 10.12+ and is available in two versions: **x64** for Intel-based Macs, and **arm64** for M1, M2, and newer Apple Silicon Macs.

## 1. Download the Application

- **arm64**: For M1, M2, or newer Apple Silicon Macs.

You can check your Mac's architecture by clicking the Apple logo in the top-left corner, selecting **About This Mac**, and looking at the **Chip** field:
